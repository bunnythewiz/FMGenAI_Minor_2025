# Data.md - EVOGEN Reproduction Conversation Summary

## Core Academic Tasks Completed

### 1. Minimal Reproduction Setup
**Prompt**: "Minimal reproduction sanity‐check - Set up the official or community re‐implementation and run one small sanity experiment to verify the method behaves as claimed qualitatively"

**Response**: Created comprehensive Colab-ready reproduction setup including:
- Environment setup with PyTorch, Diffusers, Transformers
- Minimal contrastive dataset generation (3 image pairs: color, counting, shape)
- Simplified contrastive training implementation with SimpleFeatureExtractor
- Contrastive loss function based on InfoNCE
- Training loop with loss visualization
- Expected behavior: decreasing loss over epochs, visual differences in generated pairs

### 2. Colab Adaptation Request
**Prompt**: "I want to run these on colab"

**Response**: Adapted entire setup for Google Colab environment:
- GPU runtime optimization with CUDA checks
- Memory-efficient model loading with attention slicing and CPU offloading
- Inline image visualization using matplotlib
- Error handling for package installations
- Alternative lightweight version for low-resource environments
- Comprehensive evaluation cell with CLIP-based compositional scoring

### 3. Resolution Modification Validation
**Prompt**: "I have changed the resolution to 256X256 So in that case is this ok"

**Response**: Confirmed 256x256 resolution is better for sanity check:
- 4x less memory usage than 512x512
- Faster training iterations
- Reduces CUDA OOM risk on free Colab
- Adequate for validating core methodology
- Noted input dimension consistency requirement in SimpleFeatureExtractor

### 4. Novel Dataset Evaluation (Core Academic Requirement)
**Prompt**: "Run on a new dataset (not in the paper) — core requirement. Choose a dataset or test scenario that the paper did not use..."

**Response**: Designed comprehensive medical domain evaluation:
- **Dataset**: MedComp-100 (100 medical imaging prompts)
- **Domain Shift**: Medical terminology, anatomical precision, safety-critical requirements
- **Categories**: Pathology, size/location, counting, spatial relationships, complex multi-attribute
- **Evaluation Protocol**: CLIP similarity, compositional accuracy, category-wise breakdown
- **Baseline Comparison**: EVOGEN vs Vanilla SD vs CLIP baseline vs Random
- **Results Table**: Performance metrics across medical categories
- **Error Analysis**: Three failure modes identified:
  1. Medical terminology confusion
  2. Anatomical spatial precision failures  
  3. Multi-attribute medical complexity breakdowns

### 5. Citation Request
**Prompt**: "Site all the sources, code, bolgs that you have used in a way I can copy paste in latex"

**Response**: Provided comprehensive LaTeX bibliography with:
- Primary paper citation (ICLR 2025)
- Official GitHub repository
- Technical dependencies (PyTorch, HuggingFace, CLIP)
- Evaluation benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, Attend-and-Excite)
- Medical domain references
- Implementation methodology sources
- Platform documentation (Google Colab, CUDA)
